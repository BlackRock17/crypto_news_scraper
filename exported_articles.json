    "title": "Trump Media and Semler Scientific Could Be Cheapest Bitcoin Treasury Companies by This Metric",
    "content": "A tsunami of new bitcoin BTC$108,601.20 treasury companies — firms that almost exclusively dedicate themselves to accumulating bitcoin — is flooding the market.\n\nSince all of them are more or less following Strategy’s (MSTR) playbook, questions are rising about the best ways to value them, and compare them to each other.\n\n“The most important metric for a bitcoin treasury is the premium it trades at relative to its underlying net assets, including any operating company,” Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin financial firm NYDIG, wrote in a June 6 report.\n\nOn the surface, that means adding up the company’s bitcoin, cash and enterprise value excluding the bitcoin stuff, and subtracting obligations such as debt and preferred stock. “It’s this premium that allows these companies to convert stock for bitcoins, effectively acting as a money changer converting shares for bitcoins,” Cipolaro said.\n\nOne of the most popular metrics, mNAV, measures a company’s valuation to its net asset value — in these cases, their bitcoin treasuries. An mNAV above 1.0 signals that investors are interested in paying a premium for exposure to the stock relative to its bitcoin stash; however, an mNAV below 1.0 means the equity is now worth less than the company’s holdings.\n\nBut mNAV alone is “woefully deficient” to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these firms, Cipolaro said. The research report made use of other metrics such as NAV, mNAV measured by market capitalization, mNAV by enterprise value, and equity premium to NAV to provide a more complex picture.\n\nThe table shows, for example, that Semler Scientific’s (SMLR) and Trump Media’s (DJT) equity premium to NAV (which measures the percentage difference between a fund's market price and its net asset value), are the lowest of the eight measured companies, coming in at -10% and -16% respectively, despite the fact that both companies have an mNAV above 1.1.\n\nAlas, both SMLR and DJT are little-changed on Monday even as bitcoin climbs to $108,500 versus Friday evening's $105,000 level. MSTR is higher by just shy of 5%.\n\nTom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

    "title": "U.S. SEC Chair Says Working on 'Innovation Exemption' for DeFi Platforms",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is working on policy to exempt decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms from regulatory barriers, said Chairman Paul Atkins.\n\nSoftware developers building DeFi tools have no business being blamed for how they're used, Atkins and other SEC Republicans contended at the final of five crypto roundtables that have been held at the agency since the leadership turnover under President Donald Trump.\n\nThe chairman told a roundtable of DeFi experts on Monday that he's directed the SEC staff to look into changes to agency rules \"to provide needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries to seek to administer on-chain financial systems.\" Atkins called that potential exemptive relief \"an innovation exemption\" that would let entities under SEC jurisdiction bring on-chain products and services to market \"expeditiously.\"\n\n\"Many entrepreneurs are developing software applications that are designed to function without administration by any operator,\" Atkins said in remarks at the event. While he noted the technology enabling private peer-to-peer transactions can \"sound like science fiction,\" he said \"blockchain technology makes possible an entirely new class of software that can perform these functions without an intermediary.\"\n\n\"We should not automatically fear the future,\" Atkins said.\n\nDeFi is a subsection of the broader cryptocurrency industry that seeks to recreate financial tools and products with code that replaces the role of traditional intermediaries such as banks and brokerages.\n\nThe Republican members of the commission — currently outnumbering the Democrat 3-1 — have been eager to move forward with crypto-friendly policy. While DeFi is often given short shrift in policy discussions that focus more on regulation of the higher-volume industry of crypto exchanges, brokers and custodial services. Though DeFi developers have faced years of distrust from U.S. government agencies, Republicans now in power are seeking to lighten those pressures.\n\n\"The SEC must not infringe on First Amendment rights by regulating someone who merely published code on the basis that others use that code to carry out activity that the SEC has traditionally regulated,\" said Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has led the SEC Crypto Task Force established this year. However, she also noted that \"centralized entities can't avoid regulation simply by rolling out the decentralized label.\"\n\nErik Voorhees, the founder of decentralized exchange ShapeShift, joked that when he got his first SEC subpoena 12 years ago, he didn't think he'd be invited to speak at the agency years later.\n\n\"I appreciate the change of tone and the change of stance for the commission,\" he said. \"I think that's absolutely a positive for America.\"\n\nRead More: U.S. SEC's Crypto Trading Roundtable Delves Into Easing Path for Platforms\n\nJesse Hamilton is CoinDesk's deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

    "title": "Red-Hot Circle Already Has Two ETFs Devoted to It in the Works",
    "content": "Two well-known ETF issuers are racing to bring funds to market that track the explosive rise of Circle’s newly public stock.\n\nBitwise and ProShares late Friday each submitted applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Circle (CRCL).\n\nBoth funds would give investors different ways to play the Circle’s surge, which has turned heads since the IPO late last week. Up another 9% today in volatile action, shares have nearly quadrupled from their $31 offering price.\n\nProShares, a major name in leveraged ETFs, filed to create the ProShares Ultra CRCL ETF. The fund is designed to provide twice the daily return of CRCL stock. Leveraged ETFs are popular for short-term trades but carry elevated risk due to their compounding effects over multiple days.\n\nBitwise, on the other hand, is taking a more income-focused route. Its proposed Bitwise CRCL Option Income Strategy ETF would employ a covered call strategy. That involves holding CRCL shares while regularly selling call options against them—generating cash premiums that could help smooth returns, especially if the stock’s rise cools off. This kind of fund typically appeals to investors looking for yield rather than high-octane growth.\n\nNeither fund has disclosed a ticker yet. The proposed effective date for both products is August 20, though SEC approval timelines can vary.\n\nCircle, already a central player in the stablecoin market, has drawn attention from traditional finance and crypto investors alike. If the SEC signs off on these ETFs, they could mark another step in the blending of crypto-linked equities and mainstream investing strategies.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
